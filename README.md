# COG18 Project - ManyCrypt
This is the final project for the COGS 18 course. It is an exploration into the field of cryptography and the ways that data can be transformed to achieve different goals. This project is something I hope to grow and expand upon in the near future, as the current code has lots of room for improvement and optimization.

The program takes a file as input and can either encode or decode the strings in the file using the array of ciphers available in cipherlib.py

Notes:
Files must be in the same directory as the scripts in order for the scripts to run. 
For Vernam, the operation is identical for encoding and decoding.
